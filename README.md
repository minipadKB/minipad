# Project Structure

The root folder of this repository is split into two folders, `Latest` and `Older Versions`. It is advised to only use the latest files.</br>
`Latest` contains the files for the newest version of the minipad PCB and Case.</br>
`Older Versions` contains a number of folders representing older releases of the PCBs and Cases.

Inside each versions folder you can find a `PCB` folder, containing a `2k` and `3k` folder for the two variants of the keypad, and a `Case` folder, containing the .stl files for the 3D-print.
